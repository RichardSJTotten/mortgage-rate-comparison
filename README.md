# Flask Loan Balance Calculator

This Flask application provides an API endpoint to calculate the remaining balance of a loan or investment over time given certain parameters. It uses the `numpy_financial` library for financial calculations.

## Features

- **Balance Calculation**: Computes the remaining balance of a principal amount over a specified term, considering varying interest rates and periods.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- numpy_financial

You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask numpy_financial
```

# Code Explanation

## Imports

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import numpy_financial as npf
```

# Flask Application Setup

The Flask application is initialized and configured in this section. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the Flask application is set up:

## Creating the Flask Application Instance

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

# Balance Calculation Logic

The `calculate_balance` function determines the remaining balance of a loan or investment over time. Here's a breakdown of the key variables and how the function operates:

## Key Variables

- **`principal`**: The initial amount of the loan or investment.
- **`term_years`**: The total duration of the loan or investment in years.
- **`interest_rates`**: A list of annual interest rates for different periods.
- **`period_years`**: A list of years corresponding to each interest rate.

## How It Works

1. **Convert Term to Months**:
   ```python
   term_months = term_years * 12
   ```
- Converts the total loan term from years to months for calculation.
