Flask Loan Balance Calculator
This Flask application provides an API endpoint to calculate the remaining balance of a loan or investment over time given certain parameters. It uses the numpy_financial library for financial calculations.

Features
Balance Calculation: Computes the remaining balance of a principal amount over a specified term, considering varying interest rates and periods.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Flask
numpy_financial
You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask numpy_financial
Code Explanation
Imports
python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import numpy_financial as npf
Flask: Used to create the web application.
request and jsonify: Handle API requests and responses.
numpy_financial: Provides financial functions, including pmt, for calculating payment amounts.
Flask Application Setup
python
Copy code
app = Flask(__name__)
Creates an instance of the Flask application.

Balance Calculation Logic
python
Copy code
def calculate_balance(principal, term_years, interest_rates, period_years):
    ...
Defines the calculate_balance function to compute the remaining balance over time based on:

principal: The initial loan or investment amount.
term_years: The total duration in years.
interest_rates: A list of annual interest rates for different periods.
period_years: A list of years corresponding to each interest rate.
The function:

Converts the term from years to months.
Iterates over each interest rate and period, calculates the monthly payment, and updates the balance.
Continues until the balance is zero or the term ends.
API Endpoint
python
Copy code
@app.route('/calculate_balance', methods=['POST'])
def calculate_balance_api():
    ...
Defines the /calculate_balance endpoint that accepts POST requests with JSON data. It expects:

principal: The initial amount.
term_years: Total duration in years.
interest_rates: List of annual interest rates.
period_years: List of years for each interest rate.
The endpoint:

Validates the input data.
Calls the calculate_balance function.
Returns the result as JSON or an error message if something goes wrong.
Running the Application
python
Copy code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Runs the Flask application in debug mode, useful for development.

Usage
Start the Flask Application:

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Send a POST Request: Use a tool like curl, Postman, or any HTTP client to send a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/calculate_balance with a JSON payload:

json
Copy code
{
  "principal": 100000,
  "term_years": 30,
  "interest_rates": [5, 4.5],
  "period_years": [10, 20]
}
principal: The starting amount.
term_years: The total term of the loan or investment.
interest_rates: List of interest rates for different periods.
period_years: List of years corresponding to each interest rate.
Receive Response: The response will be a JSON object containing the remaining balances:

json
Copy code
{
  "balances": [balance1, balance2, ...]
}
Error Handling
Missing required fields result in a 400 Bad Request with an error message.
